**Dash Drug Discovery Demo**

This is a demo of the Dash interactive Python framework developed by [Plotly](https://plot.ly/).

Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols required to build an interactive web-based application and is a simple and effective way to bind a user interface around your Python code.

This demo allows users to compare and explore different drug properties by selecting on the dropdown menu.
